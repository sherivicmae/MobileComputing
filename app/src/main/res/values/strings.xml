    <string name="intro">Infrared (IR) communication is a wireless technology that uses
        infrared light waves to transmit data over short distances. Operating on a
        spectrum just below visible light, IR communication is invisible to the human
        eye but can carry data through modulated light pulses. It has been widely
        used in consumer electronics, particularly in remote controls for televisions,
        audio systems, air conditioners, and other household devices.</string>

    <string name="IR_fundamentals">The basic components of an IR communication system include:\n\n
    <b>•IR Transmitter</b>: The transmitter is responsible for converting electronic signals into infrared light pulses. It typically consists of an infrared LED and a driver circuit that modulates the LED\'s intensity to encode the data.\n\n
     <b>•IR Channel </b>: The IR channel is the medium through which the infrared light travels, which is typically free space.\n\n
     <b>•IR Receiver </b>: The receiver is responsible for detecting the infrared light pulses and converting them back into electronic signals. It typically includes a photodetector, such as a photodiode or phototransistor, and supporting circuitry for signal amplification and demodulation.\n\n
     <b>•Modulation and Demodulation</b>: Modulation is the process of encoding the data onto the infrared light carrier, while demodulation is the process of decoding the data from the received infrared signal.\n\n
    The most common modulation techniques used in IR communication are:\n
    - On-Off Keying (OOK): The simplest form of modulation, where the LED is turned on and off to represent binary data.\n
    - Pulse-Position Modulation (PPM): The data is encoded by the position of the pulse within a fixed time slot.\n
    - Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM): The data is encoded by the width of the pulse within a fixed time slot.

    <string name="IRWorks"><b>1. Transmission Process</b>\n\n The transmission process in infrared communication begins with digital data in the form of binary 1s and 0s that need to be transmitted. This digital information undergoes conversion into electrical signals through specialized circuitry.
        Once converted, these electrical signals are then modulated using various techniques, with pulse width modulation being one of the most common methods. This modulation helps in making the signal more suitable for transmission and less susceptible to interference.
        The final stage of transmission involves an infrared LED, which acts as the primary transmission component. This LED converts the modulated electrical signals into pulses of infrared light,
        effectively transforming the original digital data into a form that can be transmitted through space.\n\n
        <b>2. Propagation</b>\n\n During the propagation phase, the infrared light signals travel through the transmission medium, which is typically air, although other mediums can also be used. These light signals can travel in two primary ways: either directly in a straight line between the transmitter and receiver (line of sight), or by bouncing off various surfaces such as walls and ceilings (diffuse transmission). The effective range and quality of this propagation
        depend on several critical factors. The power output of the transmitter plays a crucial role in determining how far the signal can travel.
        Environmental conditions, such as ambient light and atmospheric interference, can significantly affect signal quality. The sensitivity of the receiver determines how well weak signals can be detected,
        and physical obstacles in the transmission path can block or degrade the signal, affecting overall communication quality.\n\n
        <b>3. Reception Process</b>\n\n The reception process begins with a photodetector, typically either an IR photodiode or phototransistor,
        which is specifically designed to detect incoming infrared light signals. When these light signals reach the photodetector,
        it performs the crucial task of converting them back into electrical signals, essentially reversing the initial transmission process.
        However, these initial electrical signals are usually very weak and require amplification through specialized circuits to bring them to usable levels.
        Once amplified, the signals undergo demodulation, a process that extracts the original digital information from the modulated carrier signal.
        Finally, the receiving device processes this recovered digital data, interpreting it according to the specific communication protocol being used.
        This complete reception process ensures that the original digital information is accurately recovered and can be used by the receiving device
        as intended.</string>

    <string name="tv_BluetoothIntro">
        Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard designed for exchanging data between fixed and
        mobile devices over short distances using UHF radio waves in the ISM bands, from 2.402 GHz to
        2.480 GHz. Developed by Ericsson in 1994, Bluetooth was originally conceived as a
        wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables. The name \"Bluetooth\" comes
        from Harald Bluetooth, a 10th-century Danish king known for uniting Danish
        tribes into a single kingdom. Similarly, Bluetooth technology was intended
        to unite different communication protocols into one universal standard.</string>
